# imgurcrawl

Simple GUI program that can save images en masse from imgur galleries and albums. A valid address is of the form 
imgur.com/a/* or imgur.com/gallery/*. 

When running the program against a valid address, it will open a URL stream to the given address and retrieve the 
list images by their hash codes found inside the page's source code. The program will then open a stream to each 
image and save them to a local directory.  

Untested and inactive for at least 7 years so unsure if it still works.
